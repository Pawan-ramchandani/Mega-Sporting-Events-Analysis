# Mega-Sporting-Events-Analysis
This research investigates the economic effects of hosting mega sporting events, specifically focusing on the FIFA World Cup and the Olympics held between 2010 and 2014 in Brazil, the United Kingdom, Canada, and South Africa. Utilizing the Synthetic Control Method (SCM), the study compares the actual GDP per capita growth (GDPPCGR) of these countries to a hypothetical scenario without these events. The findings reveal that hosting such events does not significantly boost economic growth in the analyzed countries. This work aims to provide data-driven insights for policymakers to make informed decisions regarding the economic and social implications of hosting major sports events.
